## Listenlocal.ly

This (defunct) project was a local music events scraper with minimal (basic
text) UI.  It was basically a (very default, very unsecured) Django app running
on Heroku using default configuration settings.

It existed to scrape local concerts (using a service that no longer exists,
"Kimono", from "Kimono Labs") from the listings available on the "Songkick"
website, and then use that data to pull the most 'popular' track for each
local artist playing locally over the next few days (via Spotify).

When the Kimono service was still alive, this app would get a list of artists
playing nearby in the next few days (from Songkick), then get their top track
(from Spotify).  The list of artist names and the name of their top track
would be displayed, and one could listen to a 30-second sample of the top track
(via an embedded 30 second sample from Spotify).  So, one could easily hear
what sort of sound you might expect at an upcoming concert, straightforward and
without any extra advertising or self-aggrandizing notes about how the artist
or band views themselves, why they are cooler than your neighbor's Trentem√∏ller
tribute group, or other non-actionable, not super valuable information.

The unmodified code still attempts to run at http://listenlocally.herokuapp.com, where it will gladly spew forth errors due to the failure to connect to the
Kimono Labs servers any longer.

There may be reference to defunct "SECRET_KEY" values/etc in this repository.
Good luck :).
